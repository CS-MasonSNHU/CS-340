When writing code, it’s important to keep things simple, well-organized, and easy to change. In our project, we used a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Python module that let us connect the dashboard widgets to the database. This made our code more readable and easier to manage because all the database actions were in one place. It also helped us adapt quickly when we needed to change how data was fetched or updated. In the future, the same CRUD module could be used in any other project where we need to interact with a database, like adding new features or switching to a different database system.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them into smaller steps, experimenting, and then testing each piece. When Grazioso Salvare asked for a database and dashboard, I started by making sure the database could store all the information we needed, then created the dashboard to show it. Compared to earlier classes, this project required me to think more about how the front end (the dashboard) and the back end (the database) work together. In the future, I’ll keep using this method—collecting requirements, building the database structure, and then carefully linking the database to user-facing apps or dashboards—to meet client needs.

Computer scientists solve problems by designing software and systems that help people or companies work more efficiently. In a project like this, setting up a dashboard and a database lets a company like Grazioso Salvare easily track or update important animal information for rescues. This matters because it saves them time, reduces mistakes, and helps them focus on what they do best: rescuing animals. By automating data tasks and making information simple to view, computer scientists help organizations do their jobs better and make a bigger positive impact.
